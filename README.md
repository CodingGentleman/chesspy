# chesspy

Simple console chess variant. Playable with SAN inputs.

Missing feature: If two or more chessmen of the same type and colour are able to move to the target, SAN includes an indicator which piece is meant. Example: First Rook on e4, Second Rook on e6. Input R6e5. This doesn't work right now and the Rook on e4 will be chosen.
